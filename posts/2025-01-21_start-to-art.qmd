TeVincula is organising a 3-day luxury retreat in Scotland (September 19-21) and invited the incredibly talented photographer CapturedErotica and me to teach. We will give workshops on tying decorative designs and functional bondage, then capturing them through artistic photography. Iâ€™m so looking forward to seeing what we can create together.
