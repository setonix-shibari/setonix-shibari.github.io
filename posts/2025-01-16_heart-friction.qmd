I worked this one out from a [photo](https://fetlife.com/users/10727486/pictures/141751096){target="_blank"} by @sweetangelvixen on Fetlife. I tried tying it the opposite direction to this first, which is possible, but not very easy. Top-to-bottom is definitely easier.

If mobility allows, it's good to practice this one on your leg, so I did the video from that point of view.
