description: Update on my current social media accounts.

Unfortunately due to recent changes in UK law, I can't host my NSFW pictures here anymore. I have a new [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/setonix.art/) to replace the [old one](https://www.instagram.com/setonix.shibari/) I'm somehow locked out of, but they're also strict about NSFW images.

But you can find them on:

* [FetLife](https://fetlife.com/Setonix) - lots of pictures, one of the few places I post very NSFW stuff with my face in it, a few videos, and all my photos featuring other people, including the [ManyBodies project](https://fetlife.com/Setonix/posts/12032962) and the [Time War photo series](https://fetlife.com/Setonix/posts/11309021)
* [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/setonix.art) - just pictures (no face photos)
* [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/setonix-shibari) - just pictures (some face photos)
* [Purpleport](https://purpleport.com/portfolio/setonix/) - photo modelling site
* [Patreon](https://patreon.com/Setonix) - most of my video content, like timelapse and tutorials, plus photoshoot outtakes that aren't anywhere else


Patreon is the only platform that has a subscription option. Most of the content on there is for the £1/month photo outtake membership or £5/month video tutorial membership. I'll try to keep transparent earnings on there, but so far it's just covered the costs of my video hosting plus two sets of ropes (but I really appreciate the contributions!)
