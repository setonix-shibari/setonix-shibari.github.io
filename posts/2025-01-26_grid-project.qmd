I've been working on a project for the past few weeks to create a sort of "mood board" of different corsets to showcase the creative possibilities for a [workshop on improvising corset designs](2025-01-21_start-to-art.qmd).

![](../www/images/grid/setonix-grid.jpg)

I tied 36 different corsets in every colour combination of my rainbow ropes: 6 different bases (red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple) and 5 different boning patterns on each of them.
