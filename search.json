Although I‚Äôd love to make something with the pose consistency of the grid project, I also know that not everyone is comfortable with nudity or every part of their body, so models can choose any cropping, like even just a close-up of one friction over clothing.\nI‚Äôd like to collaborate with each model to write their own caption for their main photo, on the broad theme of bodies and ropes.\nThe intent would be to post each main photo as its own post on FetLife, and to make a compilation photo like the one above. I don‚Äôt think this project would lead to anything bigger (like a book or prints or a gallery exhibit) unless I sort out my photography setup sooner than I expect. But I‚Äôll have a written contract with each model so we‚Äôre clear on how we both can use the resulting photos and how we can handle it if the model needs to withdraw permission for further use of their images."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When did you start?\nI started tying in October 2023, after going to Ropes in Space (a local peer-learning ropes group). Before that, I‚Äôd been a rope bottom a few times with a play partner, so knew I really liked being tied, but wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd be any good at tying. I really liked it and decided to try to learn more. I started improvising ties and posting them to FetLife in January 2024.\n\n\nWhat resources do you use to learn?\nI tend to prefer photos to videos, so I like The Duchy‚Äôs tutorials, and also enjoyed the book Essence of Shibari, but I‚Äôve recently started watching Shibari Study‚Äôs videos and love them. I like to use tutorials to learn the basics of a new kind of tie, then tie it several times from memory, and then start to get creative with it.\nI‚Äôm still learning a lot, so I‚Äôm not an appropriate source of ropes education, especially about things like safety and suspension. I‚Äôd recommend taking in-person classes from experienced mentors if you want to get started on anything more than decorative ties.\n\n\nWhat kind of ropes do you use?\nAs of August 2024, I have new rainbow ropes from Casual Rope that are 8m/6mm linen. I really like them. They‚Äôve written a useful explainer about linen ropes.\n\nMost of my older ties are with 6mm jute, each 8 meters long. I got them on Etsy from someone I subsequently found out is problematic, so I‚Äôm hoping to learn to treat and dye my own ropes now.\n\n\nAre these really self-ties?\nIf it‚Äôs tagged self-tie, I tied myself :) For those expressing disbelief, I‚Äôm pretty flexible, have good spatial awareness to do knots behind my back, and also use some tricks to start frictions at a more accessible place and move them to the back.\n\n\nHow long does it take?\nThe more intricate corset ties usually take about an hour or two the first time if I‚Äôm improvising (and have to untie a bit when I change my mind about something), and 30-45 minutes if I‚Äôm tying them once I know what I‚Äôm doing.\nI have an 11-minute video of tying a corset base at my typical speed.\n\n\nCan I copy your ties?\nOf course! I love if you @ me in the caption of anything you post that‚Äôs inspired by my ties (I won‚Äôt accept tags in photos unless I‚Äôm directly involved like the model or rigger, though).\nI‚Äôm not sure what legal weight it holds, but I intend to share any of my own designs and images where I am the only rigger, model and photographer on a CC-BY-SA-NC license, which means you can use and remix them as long as you give me credit (BY), share resulting works under the same license (SA), and don‚Äôt use them for commercial purposes (NC).\n\n\nCan you link to the tutorials for your ties?\nMost of the ties I post are improvised, so sometimes I‚Äôm not even sure how I did them by the end. If I‚Äôm tying from someone else‚Äôs tutorial or inspired by a picture, I‚Äôll always link to it (let me know if I‚Äôm ever not giving appropriate credit).\nTutorials on this site\n\n\nDo you teach workshops?\nI don‚Äôt have any immediate plans to do online workshops, but I‚Äôd be up for teaching in-person workshops on self-tying corsets. DM me to enquire.\n\nI‚Äôm teaching an intro to self-tied corsets at the Uncensored Market June 7th\nIf we get enough people signed up, I‚Äôll be teaching a weekend workshop with Captured Erotica hosted by TeVincula September 19-21, 2025 (details here).\n\n\n\nWhere did you get those cute panties?\nThe watermelon and sun/moon pants are from a UK Etsy seller called SproutOrganic.\nThe rainbow and purple/green swirl pants are from an Etsy seller who isn‚Äôt online anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you edit your photos?\nSometimes I‚Äôll edit out parts of the background in my messy room, and I‚Äôll often adjust the colour profile of an image to make the ropes stand out more. If I edit any more than that, I will disclose it in the caption. But I will never edit the shape of my body or the ropes themselves.\n\n\nWill you tie me?\nProbably not, as I‚Äôm too busy to tie regularly with existing partners. But I‚Äôm usually at Ropes in Space, so come by and say hi if you‚Äôre in Glasgow. It‚Äôs always nice to meet in a friendly public space to check the vibes first, anyways."
