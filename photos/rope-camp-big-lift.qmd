I had the best time at Rope Camp this year! It's a weekend camping with friends and tying. This year our host set up this tall lift between two trees, as well as a hayloft suspension. The rest of my photos are NSFW, but you can see them at [FetLife](https://fetlife.com/search/pictures?q=setonix+rope+camp) or my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/big-lift-at-rope-133805805).

Safety disclaimer: this is not something you should try without confidence in load testing the rig, and accept the risk; I’ve been doing circus aerials for a few years now and rigging for about 20 months and this is the first time I’ve been comfortable with something like this. See [this post on FetLife](https://fetlife.com/Simon_Brooke/posts/7338050) for more info about the rig safety testing.
